This banana smoothie is quick and easy to make. All you have to do is add the ingredients to your blender and blend until smooth.

However, there are a few tips for how to make a smoothie that I’ve learned through experience (I’ve made a LOT of smoothies). These tips can help you to make the best smoothie, every time.

Use at least one frozen ingredient in your smoothie. Frozen fruit or veggies, such as cauliflower, help to thicken and chill your smoothie.

Err on the side of using less liquid to begin with. You can always add more liquid to get to your desired consistency.

Layer the smoothie ingredients for the most efficient blending. Greens, such as spinach or kale, should be at the bottom of the blender to give them a head start on blending up smoothly. The same goes for raw oats, nuts and frozen fruit. Add ingredients such as nut butters or yogurt on top of the fruits and vegetables to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of your blender.

Begin blending on low speed and increase to higher speed as the smoothie starts to blend together.

Don’t overfill the blender. If you are making a double or triple batch of smoothies to feed a crowd, start by adding only part of the frozen ingredients. Then add more once you get the first addition blended smooth. I do this when I make enough smoothies to feed myself and my four kids. If you fill the blender too full to start with it will be difficult to blend the smoothie.

As you blend, you may have to occasionally stop and stir, shake, or use your blender’s tamper to mix the ingredients. 

Sometimes you can get an air bubble at the bottom that prevents the blender from mixing the smoothie.

If you make smoothies often, a high powered blender can save you time and effort.
